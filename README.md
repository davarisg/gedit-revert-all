Gedit Revert-All
=========

Revert-All is a Gedit plugin for reverting all open tabs to the last saved version.

Revert-All acts like Gedit's default Revert funcitonality (File > Revert) but reverts all of you open tabs.



Installation
--------------
From the root of the repository execute the `install` script:

```sh
> ./install 
‘revert_all’ -> ‘/home/user/.local/share/gedit/plugins/revert_all’
‘revert_all/revert_all.py’ -> ‘/home/user/.local/share/gedit/plugins/revert_all/revert_all.py’
‘revert_all/revert_all.plugin’ -> ‘/home/user/.local/share/gedit/plugins/revert_all/revert_all.plugin’
```

The `install` script places the gedit plugin files in the appropriate folder.

Once this is done open gedit and the plugin should appear in the list of available plugins to enable.
